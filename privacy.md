# Privacy Policy

Last updated: March 2026

## 1. Introduction
This Privacy Policy explains how the Valorant Discord Bot ("the Bot") handles data when used within Discord servers.

## 2. Data Collection
The Bot does **not** collect, store, or process any personal data from users.

Specifically:
- No usernames, user IDs, or message content are stored
- No server (guild) data is stored
- No direct messages are read or logged

All interactions with the Bot are handled in real time and are not persisted.

## 3. Use of Third-Party Services
The Bot retrieves publicly available information from third-party APIs, including:
- Valorant API (https://valorant-api.com)
- Liquipedia API (https://liquipedia.net/api)

These services may have their own privacy policies and terms. The Bot does not control or assume responsibility for how these third-party services handle data.

## 4. Cookies and Tracking
The Bot does not use cookies, analytics, tracking pixels, or any form of user tracking.

## 5. Data Sharing
No data is shared with third parties, as no user data is collected or stored by the Bot.

## 6. Children’s Privacy
The Bot does not knowingly collect personal data from children under the age of 13.
Use of Discord itself is governed by Discord’s own age requirements.

## 7. Changes to This Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. Continued use of the Bot after any changes indicates acceptance of the updated policy.
